    <div class = "border"> Number Five, the calmest character of media </h1>
        <p class="colored">Number Five was an obsessive, short-tempered, and intelligent member of the Umbrella Academy, and one of the superpowered children conceived from the Marigolds. Possessing the ability to teleport through space and time travel at will, he found himself trapped in a post-apocalyptic future for forty-five years, and his trip home warped his fifty-eight-year-old body back to thirteen. However, he retained his much older consciousness. </div>  
   <div class = "gold"> At age 13, Five became trapped in the apocalyptic future for more than 40 years. When he found a way back, his body regressed to that of his 13-year-old self while his mind stayed the same. As a result, he has the personality of a 60-year-old and is frustrated at being trapped in a child's body. He is shown to have a genius intellect, often dismissing others, including his family, as stupid or inferior and expressing disinterest in their personal affairs. He is also shown to be sarcastic, pragmatic, and incredibly prideful. He also exhibits impulsive behavior due to his prideful nature. This is seen when he brazenly uses his time-traveling powers as a boy despite Reginald Hargreeves' warnings that he was not fully prepared to wield them. Five is also shown to be a ruthless and incredibly efficient killer. While he does not enjoy killing, he seems to have no qualms about the people he has killed. He is more than willing to eliminate anyone, even innocent people, whose deaths may stop the apocalypse from happening. He even displays nonchalance when making plans to murder them. He gained fame in his time as an agent of the Temps Commission for his success in killing countless individuals on missions, which he did as part of his contract to get back home to the present. Overall, Number Five has shown to be perfectly willing to eliminate anyone who stands in the way of his goals.  </div>
    <p class="colored">Recruited by the Temps Commission in the apocalyptic wasteland, Five became one of their most revered agents, a skilled killer maintaining order across the timelines, but when he left them to reunite with his family, he became their primary target as he and the Academy traveled throughout time to prevent various apocalyptic threats.  </p>
