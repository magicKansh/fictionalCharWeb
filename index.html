    <h1> Number Five, the calmest character of media </h1>
    <p class="colored">Number Five was an obsessive, short-tempered, and intelligent member of the Umbrella Academy, and one of the superpowered children conceived from the Marigolds. Possessing the ability to teleport through space and time travel at will, he found himself trapped in a post-apocalyptic future for forty-five years, and his trip home warped his fifty-eight-year-old body back to thirteen. However, he retained his much older consciousness.  </p>
    <p class="colored">Recruited by the Temps Commission in the apocalyptic wasteland, Five became one of their most revered agents, a skilled killer maintaining order across the timelines, but when he left them to reunite with his family, he became their primary target as he and the Academy traveled throughout time to prevent various apocalyptic threats.  </p>
